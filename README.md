# Catapults_SGD

There are currently four notebooks available:

1. Catapult_GD_CIFAR.ipynb
2. Catapult_SGD_CIFAR.ipynb
3. Catapult_SGD_2layer_CIFAR2.ipynb
4. Catapult_GD_index_2.ipynb
   
Notebooks 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the experiments discussed in Section 3: Catapults in Optimization.

Notebook 4 demonstrates how catapults enhance generalization by promoting AGOP alignment in the index-2 regression task.

Additional notebooks for the remaining experiments will be added in due course.

## Requirements: 
Python 3
