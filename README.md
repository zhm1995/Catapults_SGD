# Catapults_SGD

There are currently three notebooks available:

1. Catapult_GD_CIFAR.ipynb
2. Catapult_SGD_CIFAR.ipynb
3. Catapult_GD_index_2.ipynb
4. 
Notebooks 1 and 2 correspond to the experiments discussed in Section 3: Catapults in Optimization.
Notebook 3 demonstrates how catapults enhance generalization by promoting AGOP alignment in the index-2 regression task.

Additional notebooks for the remaining experiments will be added in due course.

## Requirements:
